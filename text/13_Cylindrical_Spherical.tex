\section{Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates}\label{sec:cylindrical_spherical}

\noindent\textbf{\large Triple Integration with Cylindrical Coordinates}\\

Cylindrical coordinates are good for describing solids that are symmetric around an axis.  The solid is three dimensional, and so we use the coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$ for points in this solid.  In short, the radius $r$ and angle $\theta$ are the same as in polar coordinates, with $r$ being the distance out from axis and $\theta$ being the angle around the axis, with the positive $x$-axis being the direction of $\theta = 0$ as usual. The coordinate $z$ is the same as in the Cartesian system - the vertical distance up the axis.  See Figure \ref. \\

The conversions between cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates are given as follows, which follows from our previous study of polar coordinates.\\

\keyidea{idea:cylcart_conversion}{Converting between cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates}{
Given a point $(r,\theta,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates, its Cartesian coordinates are
$$x = r \cos\theta, \: y = r \sin\theta, \: z = z.$$
Given a point $(x,y,z)$ in Cartesian coordinates, we use
$$r^2 = x^2 + y^2, \: \tan\theta = \dfrac{y}{x}, \: z = z$$
to convert to cylindrical coordinates.\\

\example{ex_cartcyl_convert}{}{Write the point $(\sqrt{3},1,-1)$ in cylindrical coordinates.}{Since we are given the Cartesian coordinates, we use the above conversion formulas to convert this point to cylindrical coordinates.  Since $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$, we arrive at $$r = \sqrt{3+1} = 2.$$ Since $\tan\theta = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, it follows that $\theta = \dfrac{\pi}{6}$ as the point is in the first quadrant of the $xy$-plane.  Therefore the cylindrical coordinates of this point are $\left( 2, \frac{\pi}{6}, -1\right)$. \\

Certain surfaces and solids are conveniently described using cylindrical coordinates. For example, consider the solid half-cylinder $D$ of radius $1$ centered on the $z$-axis with the bottom on the $xy$-plane and the top at $z = 3$.  If the half-cylinder is above the first two quadrants of the $xy$-plane, then the coordinates that describe this solid are
$$0 \leq r \leq 1, \: 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi, \: 0 \leq z \leq 3.$$
This half-cylinder is shown in Figure \ref. \\

Surfaces and solids described using Cartesian coordinates can also be written using cylindrical coordinates, and vice versa, using our conversion formulas above.\\

\example{ex_cylsurface}{}{Consider the surface described by $z=r^2$ in cylindrical coordinates.  Write the equation for this surface in Cartesian coordinates and identify the surface.}{We know that $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$, and so we can write $z = x^2 + y^2$.  This is a paraboloid with vertex at the origin opening up. See Figure \ref. \\
}  



When integrating over a solid $D$ described with cylindrical coordinates, one would evaluate an integral $\displaystyle\iiint_D f(x,y,z) \: dV$, but using $dr$, $d\theta$, and $dz$ instead of $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$.  The differential of volume $dV$ would be $$dV = r \: dr \: d\theta \: dz$$ since we are working with the same two coordinates $r$ and $\theta$ from polar coordinates and the third coordinate is the same as in the Cartesian system.  This is the volume of the curved box in Figure \ref.  In other words, the integral above becomes
$$\displaystyle\iiint_D f(x,y,z) \: dV = \displaystyle\iiint_D f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z) \: r \: dr \: d\theta \: dz$$
where each occurrence of $x$ and $y$ in the integrand has been converted to cylindrical coordinates.  The bounds on each integral would be the corresponding bounds on $r$, $\theta$, and $z$ that describe the solid $D$.\\

\example{ex_cylindervolume}{}{Compute the volume of the half-cylinder $D$described previously, for $0 \leq r \leq 1$, $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$, $0 \leq z \leq 3$.}{Since we are computing the volume of $D$, the integrand is $f(x,y,z) = 1$ and so
$$V = \iiint_D \: dV = \iiint_D \: r \: dr \: d\theta \: dz.$$
Using our bounds on $r$, $\theta$, and $z$ that describe $D$ as our bounds of integration, we get a volume of
$$V = \int_0^3 \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^1 r \: dr \: d\theta \: dz = \int_0^3 \int_0^{\pi} \dfrac{1}{2} \: d\theta \: dz = \dfrac{3\pi}{2}$$
cubic units.\\
}

\example{ex_conevolume}{}{The surface $z = 1 - r$ encloses a conical solid between itself and the $xy$-plane.  Find the volume of this solid as seen in Figure \ref.}{The cone $z = 1-r$ intersects the $xy$-plane ($z = 0$) at a radius of $r = 1$.  This puts the bounds on $r$ as $0 \leq r \leq 1$, and clearly the bounds on $\theta$ would be $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$ since the solid is the full cone.  Since the solid is not a cylinder, at least one of the bounds on $z$ must be non-constant.  At any radius $r$, the height of the solid is bounded between the $xy$-plane and the surface $z = 1-r$.  Therefore the bounds on $z$ are $0 \leq z \leq 1-r$, and we will integrate with respect to $dz$ first.  Therefore the volume is
$$V = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{1-r} r \: dz \: dr \: d\theta = 2\pi \int_0^1 (1-r)r \: dr$$
which evaluates to a volume of $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$ cubic units.\\

\example{ex_volume02}{}{A solid $D$ is the region inside the cylinder $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, below the plane $z = 2$ and above the paraboloid $z = 1 - x^2 - y^2$, with all distances in meters.  See Figure \ref.  If the density of this solid is 
$$\delta(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$
kilograms per cubic meter, determine the mass of this solid.}{As this solid is a cylinder with a paraboloid cut out of the bottom, it makes sense to use cylindrical coordinates here, where the mass is the integral of the density over the solid.  The solid is described by
$$0 \leq r \leq 1, \: 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi, \: 1-x^2-y^2 = 1-r^2 \leq z \leq 2$$
and the density function, when converted to cylindrical coordinates, is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = \sqrt{r^2} = r.$  Integrating using the order $dz \: d\theta \: dr$ and the additional factor of $r$ for cylindrical coordinates yields a mass of
$$\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{1-r^2}^{2} r \: r \: dz \: d\theta \: dr = 2\pi \int_0^1 r^2 - r^4 \: dr = 2\pi \left( \dfrac{1}{12} \right) = \dfrac{\pi}{6}$$
kilograms.\\

\noindent\textbf{\large Triple Integration with Spherical Coordinates}\\

Objects bounded by spheres or cones are more easily described using a different coordinate system called spherical coordinates.  The Earth, for example, is a solid sphere (or near enough). On its surface we use two coordinates - latitude and longitude. To dig inward or fly outward, there is a third coordinate, the distance $\rho$ from the center. This Greek letter \textit{rho} replaces radius $r$ to avoid confusion with cylindrical coordinates. Where $r$ is measured from the $z$-axis, $\rho$ is measured directly from the origin. Thus 
$$\rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$$
which is the square of the distance between the origin and the point $(x,y,z)$. The angle $\theta$ is the same as before, and it goes from $0$ to $2\pi$ with $0$ pointing in the direction of the positive $x$-axis. It is the longitude, which increases as you travel east around the Equator. The angle $\phi$ is new, however. It equals $0$ at the North Pole and $\pi$ (not $2\pi$) at the South Pole. It is the polar angle, measured down from the $z$-axis. The Equator, for example, has a latitude of $0$ degrees but a polar angle of $\phi$ of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ instead. See Figure \ref. 

The spherical coordinates of a point $(x,y,z)$ is given by the ordered triple $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$ where $\rho \geq 0$ and $0 \leq \phi \leq \pi$.  The relationship between spherical and Cartesian coordinates is illustrated by Figure \ref.  From the triangles, we have
$$z = \rho \cos\phi \text{ and } r = \rho \sin\phi$$
But we know that $x = r \cos\theta$ and $y = r \sin\theta$ from before, so we end up with the following conversion equations.\\

\keyidea{idea:sphericalcart_conversion}{Converting between spherical and Cartesian coordinates}{
Given a point $(\rho, \theta, z)$ in spherical coordinates, its Cartesian coordinates are
$$x = \rho \sin\phi \cos\theta, \: y = \rho \sin\phi \sin\theta, \: z = \rho \cos\phi.$$
Given a point $(x,y,z)$ in Cartesian coordinates, we use
$$\rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, \tan\theta = \dfrac{y}{x}, \cos\phi = \dfrac{z}{\rho} = \dfrac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$$
to convert to spherical coordinates.\\
}

\example{ex_spherconvert}{}{The point $\left( 3, \dfrac{\pi}{6}, \dfrac{2\pi}{3}\right)$ is given in spherical coordinates.  What is the Cartesian coordinate representation of this point?}{Using the conversion equations above, we have
\begin{align*}
x & = \rho \sin\phi \cos\theta = 3 \sin\left( \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = 3\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \dfrac{9}{4} \\
y & = \rho \sin\phi \sin\theta = 3 \sin\left( \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right = 3\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\left( \frac{1}{2}\right) = \dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} \\
z & = \rho \cos\phi = 3 \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \dfrac{3}{2}\\
which corresponds to the Cartesian coordinates of $\left( \dfrac{9}{4}, \dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}, \dfrac{3}{2}\right)$.\\
\end{align*}

Surfaces like spheres and cones can be easily described in spherical coordinates.  For example, $\rho = R$ describes the surface of a sphere of radious $R$, while $\phi = \dfrac{\pi}{3}$ describes a conical surface opening up at a $60$ degree angle from $z$-axis (or a $30$ degree angle from the $xy$-plane). Some solids, such as cones or parts of spheres, have bounds which are easily described in spherical coordinates, too.  For example, the bounds
$$0 \leq \rho \leq 1, 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi, \dfrac{\pi}{2} \leq \phi \leq \pi$$
describes the solid lower half unit sphere, while the bounds
$$0 \leq \rho \leq 1, 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \phi \leq \dfrac{\pi}{4}$$
describes a conical solid opening up with a spherical top.\\
