{Verify the identity $\operatorname{dilog}(x)+\operatorname{dilog}(-x)=\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{dilog}\big(x^2\big)$ by verifying equality for a particular value of $x$ and verifying the derivatives of each side are equal.
}
{At $x=0$, both sides are 0.  The derivative of the left side is $-\frac{\ln(1-x)}{x}-\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}$.  By algebra and rules of logarithms, this can be shown equivalent to the derivative of the right side, which is $-\frac{\ln\big(1-x^2\big)}{x}$.
