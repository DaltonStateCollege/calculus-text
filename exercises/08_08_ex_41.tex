{\label{dilog3}Verify the identity $\operatorname{dilog}(1-x)+\operatorname{dilog}\left(1-\frac{1}{x}\right)=-\frac{1}{2}(\ln x)^2$ for $x>0$ by verifying equality for a particular value of $x$ and verifying the derivatives of each side are equal.
}
{At $x=1$, both sides are 1.  After algebraic simplifications, it can be shown that the derivative of each side is $-\frac{\ln x}{x}$.
