{An arena is to be made with volume 7680 m$^3$ and shaped as a rectangular box.  The base will be made of slate, which costs \$20/m$^2$.  The roof and all but one of the sides will be made of glass, which costs \$4/m$^2$.  The remaining side will be made of corn, which costs \$1/m$^2$.  Determine the dimensions of the arena at which the cost of materials is minimized.
