{\label{ex:07_02_ex_23}The goal is to derive the formula for the volume $V$ of a sphere with radius $r$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A sphere with radius $r$ can be formed by revolving what curve about which line?
\item Use your answer to (a) and the disk method to determine a formula for the volume of a sphere.
\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item Answers may vary.
\item $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
\end{enumerate}
}
