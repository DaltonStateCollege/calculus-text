{\noindent In Exercises}
{, we explore the dilogarithm function $\operatorname{dilog}(x)=\int_0^x - \frac{\ln(1-t)}{t} dt$, a non-elementary function which is an antiderivative of $-\ln(1-x)/x$.  (Since $-\ln(1-x)/x$ has a removable discontinuity at $x=0$, there is no problem with this integration.)
