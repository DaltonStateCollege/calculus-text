{The goal is to derive the formula for the volume $V$ of a right circular cone with height $h$ and base radius $r$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Such a cone can be formed by revolving what curve about which line?
\item Use your answer to (a) and the disk method to determine a formula for the volume.
\end{enumerate}
}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item Answers may vary.
\item $V=\frac{1}{3}\pi h r^2$
\end{enumerate}
}
