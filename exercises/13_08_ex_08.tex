{This is a region of space, a half of a solid cone with rounded top, where the rounded top is a portion of the ball of radius 2 centered at the origin and the sides of the cone make an angle of $\pi/4$ with the positive $z$-axis. The bounds on $\theta$ mean only the portion ``above'' the $x$-$z$ plane are retained.
